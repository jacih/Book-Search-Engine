## [Description](#table-of-contents)
The Book Search Engine is a MERN stack application in need of a refactor to transition away from the RESTful API it was built with. As the app was fully functional using it's RESTful API, the challenge was parsing through the existing code and determining what code could remain as is, what could be adapted, and what could be removed in order to maintain UX in the updated app. Upon arriving on the landing page, the user is able to search books, login in to their account, or sign up to their account. As a registered user, they are able to save books to their profile which consists of a total book count, a collage of the users saved books, and a delete button on each saved book to remove the chosen book from the profile.

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
